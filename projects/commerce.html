                This is an ecommerce website based on auctions,
                where you can post, bid, and comment other items.
                You can open an account by registering.
                You are able to post images of your items, delete items,
                edit items, and close the auction - letting the highest bid user win the item.
                You can browse items based on category, activity, and watchlist.

                I learned a lot from this project: 
                Deep knowledge on the fundamentals of Django, 
                working with official documentation,
                django signals, test driven development, 
                python libraries like OS,
                handling user uploaded images, 
                basic deployment on heroku, etc.

                The fist working version of this project (as of this writing)
                was finished on <strong>March 7<sup>th</sup> 2022.</strong>
            </p>

            <p class="project-text">
                This is an ecommerce website based on auctions.
                You can register yourself as a user and start using the application right away. 
                Login and logout whenever you need to.
            </p>

            <p class="project-text">
                The main functionality of this app revolves around creating items in a certain category, 
                sharing them with the rest of the world,
                and bidding on other people's items, and let other people bid on yours.
            </p>

            <p class="project-text">
                With your own item, you can decide to close the auction, 
                letting the highest bid user win your item, edit your item, delete it,
                or even comment it yourself.
            </p>

            <p class="project-text">
                With other people's items, you may bid on them, comment them, 
                or add them to your personal watchlist so you can have them in sight anytime.
            </p>

            <p class="project-text">
                You may browse items by applying filters like the most populars (items with the highest activity),
                recent (those who were updated least), view by categories (like books or electronics),
                watchlist, or your active items.

            <h3 class="project-section-title">More about the app</h3>
            <p class="project-text">
                This app was deployed using Heroku.
            </p>
            
            <p class="project-text">
                I spent around two weeks working on the basic features of the app,
                and one additional month testing, adding new features,
                and styling the application with CSS.

            <p class="project-text">
                If the user doesn't upload an image, 
                a default appropriate image representing an empty image is used.
                Images must be <strong>at most 2MB in size.</strong> 
                Current validation accepts only .jpg, .jpeg, and .png file formats.
            </p>

            <p class="project-text">
                Passwords are hashed automatically by Django, 
                so there's no risk in your password being revealed.

            <p class="project-text">
                There are many features ideas that I may add some time in the future,
                you can check them out on this project's Github repository README.
                I would honestly like to eventually turn this project into a fully working,
                complete commercial application.

        <section class="project-section">
            <h3 class="project-section-title">Obstacles and how I faced them</h3>
            <p class="project-text">
                As with any project or working on something you're not familiar with,
                obstacles will naturally appear as you work on features on your project.
                I did encounter handful of them, but I will mention the most prominent ones.
            </p>
            
            <p class="project-text">
                <strong>Storing user-uploaded images.</strong>
                When I started thinking about how I would handle the images in this app,
                the first thing that popped out of my mind was "wait a second,
                how do databases store images?" After a bit of research, 
                I found out that they don't. Dedicated cloud servers like AWS or Azure
                are required for these kind of tasks. The problem is, to use AWS or Azure,
                I need a credit card, which I don't have, so I thought about storing user images
                within the folder directory. After a bit of workarounds and tweaking with 
                Django project settings, I was able to store user-uploaded files in a dedicated 
                folder within the project directory.
            </p>

            <p class="project-text">
                The next problem I encountered is related to the one mentioned above:
                <strong>Delete user-uploaded images no longer in use.</strong>
                One might naturally assume that if you delete the item an image belongs to,
                the image will also disappear, but it doesn't. This is a problem because,
                on a scalable app, in the long run a lot of images would end up clustering up
                in the folder that are not necessary anymore, so I had to figure out a way of
                deleting an image as soon as its respective item gets deleted as well.
                That's when I found out about Django signals. I learned about them,
                and connected a couple of those so the image is deleted along with the item,
                or the image is deleted when the item's image is edited and replaced.
            </p>

            <p class="project-text">
                What's described above also leads to another problem.
                What if there is no image to begin with? Deleting something that doesn't
                exist would cause an error, so I had to find a way of 
                <strong>Asserting that an image exists.</strong>
                This lead to studying the Python "os" module and using os.path.exists() method.
                As its name tells, this method let's you know whether a path exists.
            </p>

            <p class="project-text">
                A combination of everything described above lead to pretty interesting
                things I could do with Djagno Signals: handling empty user image inputs
                for a default, handling the popularity feature, handling the updated_at
                attribute, etc.
            </p>

        <section class="project-section">
            <h3 class="project-section-title">What I learned</h3>
            <p class="project-text">
                There are plenty of things I learned through this experience.
                The most prominent is now my overall <strong>growth</strong> as a developer.
                Although the app is by itself quite simple - nothing too complex - 
                I had to apply many of the web development practices fundamentals,
                which led to learning about web development in general and a deeper 
                knowledge of the Python programming language, the Django Framework,
                HTML, and CSS. 
            </p>

            <p class="project-text">
                A best practice I enforced myself to follow on this project was 
                <strong>TDD (Test Driven Development)</strong>, 
                which is about working first on writing the tests for a particular feature,
                then write the code to pass those tests. At first, it felt awkward to do things this way,
                but I kept doing it because I'm aware it's a software best practice used to produce
                high quality code and build more robust applications.
                One thing that greatly helped me (and if it helped me, 
                I'm sure it's a common practice used under a name I don't yet know), 
                is to figure out exactly how do you want your feature to behave under all scenarios,
                and then write it all out. With this, it's easier to write the tests for it, 
                and consequently, the real code that follows.
                This was such a smooth process that I got super impressed! 
                Bugs were so easy to find and fix, and I knew for sure the application
                would behave the way I wanted to. I'm definitely doing TDD in any opportunity I can.
            </p>
            
            <p class="project-text">
                <strong>Django</strong> has a pretty vast ecosystem, there's almost always a module for
                everything you need web related. I familiarized myself with many of the
                Django-way of doing things: Models, urls, project settings, quering databases,
                signals, CRUD operations, testing, request and response objects,
                static file management, user uploaded files, template language (Jinja),
                Django CLI commands from the project directory like shell, 
                got familiar with the official documentation, and much more.
            </p>

            <p class="project-text">
                As for <strong>Python</strong>, since Django works with Python, 
                I inevitably learned more about the language itself in general.
                I feel I improved a lot with Python Object Oriented Programming.
                I particularly learned a lot about the "os" and "os.path",
                since they were required for this project. 
                Using Python, I learned how to remove files, work around directories,
                and even execute shell commands. I also got a bit familiar
                with the 'subprocess' module.
            </p>

            <p class="project-text">
                For <strong>HTML and CSS</strong>, I did my best to apply good practices.
                For example, keeping the HTML code clean, give the elements meaningful class names,
                use HTML semantic elements, and use mobile first approach.
                It's amazing how I didn't know much how to do complex things on CSS a month ago,
                things like Flexbox, Grid, or media queries. 
                I got so familiar with Flexbox, that it has virtually become second nature.
                I also used Grid to some extent. I now feel confident working with boxes,
                moving them around, and making the site follow the planned layout.
            </p>

            <h3 class="project-section-title">Conclusion</h3>
            <p class="project-text">
                If you've read everything so far, that's great! I would like to announce something.
                From all the experience I acquired working on this project, and for all
                the best practices I enforced myself to use during the process, I can confidently state that 
                <strong><i>
                    I feel capable of successfully working on professional projects that involve
                    Django, Python, HTML/CSS, or any the sort. 
                    I proved myself I can learn fast to achieve whatever may be required for the project,
                    while keeping the code as clean, as robust, as readable, and as scalable as posible.
