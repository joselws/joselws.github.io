                This is a Django project that scrapes advertisement data from the page
                anuncioneon.es (site in Spanish) and stores them in the database.
                Data was scraped from the home page and each advertisement category.
                This project was done in 12 hours as a technical test for a job.
            </p>

            <p class="project-text">
                I learned many things I was not familiar with in this project.
                I learned how to request data with the requests module, 
                scrape data and parse them with BeautifulSoup, 
                follow object-oriented design in building webscrapers,
                use regular expressions to get specific substring data I needed,
                use multithreading to speed up the data request process,

                The fist working version of this project (as of this writing)
                was finished on <strong>March 18<sup>th</sup> 2022.</strong>

                This is a Django project that gets data from anuncioneon.es website.
                You can look at the homepage, which has information about all the
                available categories and subcategories, and also explore available ads
                on their corresponding sections. Each ad has a title, subtitle, 
                small description, price, and an optional image.
            </p>

            <p class="project-text">
                There is a filter section in which you can search for specific ads that
                matches your query on title and description. 
                You may additionally also filter by category.

                The heart of this app is on the web scraper program, in which all the

                From the requests and HTML parsing, 
                to multithreading the data.

            <h3 class="project-section-title">Obstacles and how I faced them</h3>
            <p class="project-text">
                For most of the data fetching, parsing, and scraping process,
                it was pretty straightforward progress and posed no difficulties.
            </p>
            
            <p class="project-text">
                At some point, I had to <strong>extract a specific substring </strong> 
                located in an "a" HTML tag, in the "href" attribute. 
                I thought hard how to solve it using normal string operations on Python, 
                but figured the most direct and easiest way to solve the problem was by using 
                <strong>Regular Expressions.</strong>
            </p>
            
            <p class="project-text">
                All the data fetching from the 20 different category pages 
                was taking a lot of time to complete,
                so I learned how to speed up the process by using 
                <strong>multithreading.</strong> 
                I spent significant time learning about this new concept for me,
                and decided to implement this behavior with <strong>ThreadPoolExecutor()</strong> 
                in Python's concurrent.futures module.
                <strong>This cut the time it took to fetch all the data by 3.</strong>
            </p>
            
            <p class="project-text">

        </section>

        <section class="project-section">
            <h3 class="project-section-title">What I learned</h3>
            <p class="project-text">
                I learned a lot about new concepts previously unknown to me,
                not only limited to Python or Django, 
                but also about <strong>Software Development</strong> in general.
                For example, I placed more emphasis in <strong>Object oriented programming</strong>
                and experienced the benefits of using this paradigm to achieve greater code quality,
                maintainability, testability, readability, and so on.
            </p>

            <p class="project-text">
                I learned how to do <strong>web scraping</strong>, 
                and this is an important skill to have in general, I believe. 
                My confidence in programming is now higher.
                I learned how to fetch data using the <strong>Requests</strong> Python module, 
                and parse its contents using <strong>BeautifulSoup</strong>, 
                locating all the data I needed for the project.
            </p>

            <p class="project-text">
                I learned about <strong>multithreading</strong> and <strong>multiprocessing</strong>, 
                their differences, and when to use one over the other.
            </p>

            <p class="project-text">
                I also learned how to work on <strong>deadlines</strong> and under pressure,
                as I only had <strong>24 hours</strong> available to finish this project,
                and I worked on it for around 12 hours since I had other appointments that day.

            <h3 class="project-section-title">Conclusion</h3>
            <p class="project-text">
                I'm proud of having completed this project in such a short amount of time,
                provided all the functionalities I had to deliver from ground zero. In general,
                this was a great experience in which I learned many skills I didn't have at the time,
                like webscraping, regular expressions, or multithreading. I could also demonstrate
                my ability to work under pressure and under tight deadlines, while providing
                a satisfactory functionality and meeting the requirements.
